Metrics for evaluating the performance and complexity of computer programs

## Components:

### rafComputing

The ML-based tool implementing the process of automatically tailoring a suitable rComplexity Class for an algorithm.

### WebMonitoring

A tool for monitoring multiple network resources and websites.
Gather data by periodically monitoring specific resources and websites and stores results in database.

#### ResourceManager

Monitors all resources by periodically (timer set default at 1 hour interval) sending requests to existing resources.
Store simple metrics like total time or total requests answer as entries in DB.

#### WebsiteManager

Monitors all websites by periodically (timer set default at 1 hour interval) generating a HAR (HTTP-Archieve data performance file) for loading metrics corresponding to a website, with Chrome using Browsermob-Proxy.
Also parse and store valuable insights resulted from the HAR file into DB.
The service uses [speedprofile](https://github.com/parasdahal/speedprofile) engine.

#### WebMonitoring API

Provide an API for interrogating useful metrics from DB.

### Login

Backend implementation to provide a simple authentication, registration and management for users inside rafMetrics platform.

### DockerConfig

Keeps track of all Docker Compose/Docker Swarm settings and configurations.

### KubernetesConfig

Keeps track of all k8s settings

### MySQL

Database used to store persistent data required by Login and WebMonitoring.
All relations are kept in **Boyce-Codd Normal Form**.

### deploy_repo.sh

Simple script to ensure dockerize and deployment in Kubernetes for all backend components

### metricsUI

Frontend implementation of rafMetrics platform based on Flatlogic Template: React Material Admin â€” Material-UI Dashboard
