\section{The game of chess}

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid.

The history of chess was firstly documented around 6th Century, although the earliest origins are ambiguous. It is believed that the game's predecessor was originated in India, from where the game spread to Persia. After the Arabic occupation, the game was spread through the Muslim world and to Southern Europe, where it evolved into the current form in the 15th Century ~\cite{murray1913history}.
